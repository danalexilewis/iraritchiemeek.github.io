      <em>Why should I use version Control?</em>
      There are many benifits to using a version control system such such as Git, here are just a few to convince you.
        <ul>
          <li>It allows you to save many versions of the same file as you progress. This means if you mess up you can easily go back to a previous version instead of having to start over.</li>
          <li>You can experiment on multiple versions of your code, and then easily look back at them and choose the best version.</li>
          <li>If a bug/issue is introduced there are commands you can use to find out where that bug was introduced and then rollback to that version.</li>
          <li>You always have multiple backups of your work.</li>
          <li>If you're working in teams you can work on the same file at the same time and see who made the changes and when.</li>
          <li>It provides you with a full history of your code and keeps track of changes you have made that you can easily look back on.</li>
        </ul>

    </p>

        GitHub could be thought of as an online version of Git although there are some differences between the two. Storing your code on GitHub allows others to look at your code, copy your code, suggest changes and give you feedback, depending on whether or not you make your code public this could be complete strangers or only people you allow access to.
        For developers, letting the world access their code can be a great tool to help a new project advance with the help of other developers adding their own changes or fixes and sending a pull request, which the developer can then decide to merge the changes into the original work.
